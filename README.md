particle-skycons
================

About
-----
A port of the popular [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/) JavaScript
library to the Particle Photon (and possibly other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers).


What You Need
-------------

 - A Particle Photon (or other compatible device)
 - An SSD1306 OLED display


How to Use
----------
This library extends the Adafruit SSD1306 library ([here](https://github.com/pkourany/Adafruit_SSD1306)
or [here](https://github.com/pkourany/Adafruit_SSD1306_mfGFX_IDE)), so you will
need to use it and its Adafruit GFX dependency.
